### Further Learning
Once you're done the 4-part email series, you can check out my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_nJ4PiyzE26LX-FmrnvCfQ) for more

If you want a vault with even more guidance and instantly usable workflows, you can download the vault system I use every day for learning and productivity [here](https://johnmavrick.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-vault).
# Vault Features
You can either use this as your starter vault, or transfer the templates into a new vault.

I already imported the required plugins (dataview, templater) to use my templates so you can play around with adjusting and importing them into new notes.

## Template Configuration
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/7JMRrskgw7I) to learn how to import and use your templates: 

If the templates don't automatically load upon note creation, be sure to enable the "Trigger Templater file on new file creation" setting.

To choose what template to use, press `Ctrl + Shift + T` or in command pallete search `Template: Open Insert Template Modal`

If you manually import the templates each time via a hotkey, then you might need to run a command to trigger the templates (you can manually do it by opening command pallete `Ctrl/Cmd + P` and then typing in `Replace templates in the active file`

the `<% tp.file.cursor %>` are just jump points for the cursor, which you can jump to by pressing `Alt+8` or using the command `Jump to next cursor location`

I added the Calendar plugin to make trying out the daily and weekly note templates easier.

Just view the calendar pane on the right side-bar, and click on a date/week to automatically create a new note.

If you create a new note in the book folder, it will automatically import the Book template :)
