### a word on tasks
Obsidian as a feature to search for tasks, open or done, see in  [[../../../00 Inbox/001 ✔️ToDo]].
I don´t want the moved tasks to show up there, but for journaling / logging reasons I still want to see what was done / on the ToDo list that day. So unfinished tasks don´t get deleted from the daily notes, they get moved to the next day and marked with an M so the search for open tasks don´t shows them in all the old notes multiple times.

- [ ] Open Task
- [x]  Done Tasks
- [M]  Task moved to next day
- [C]  canceled task
